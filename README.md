# Search-Bias-Evaluation
**Information Retrieval Journal 2020 - Evaluation metrics for measuring bias in search engine results**

This is the dataset that was used for search bias evaluation in the paper.

You can find the document URLs, titles, and textual contents of the top10 SERPs for Bing and Google in the corresponding .zip files.
Moreover, in the excel file there are two sheets:

1. The first one includes document IDs with crowd labels,
2. The second one contains query IDs with the corresponding topic and query information,
3. The second sheet also contains topic ideology label information that is necessary for transforming stance labels into ideology labels.
